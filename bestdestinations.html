                With its incredible history, which stretches back in time, until the birth of civilizations, Egypt is considered one of the oldest tourist destinations on Earth. 
                For thousands of years, awe-inspiring temples and pyramids have made a very strong impression on tourists. 
                Although most visitors come for the ancient monuments, there are some that are attracted by natural attractions: 
                the Red Sea coast is famous for coral reefs and seaside resorts, and a trip across the Sahara will take the visitor to refreshing freshwater oases.
